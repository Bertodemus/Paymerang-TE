## **Description**

Greetings and salutations! Thank you for taking the time to review my technical test submission. I cannot wait to get your feedback, suggestions, and constructive criticism! I believe that is one of the best ways to learn and improve. Here is a link to the deployed site: [Technical Test](https://ecstatic-jepsen-96302a.netlify.app/)   

For this test, I decided to use `create-react-app` as my starter toolchain. I created a `single page` site that takes the provided blob of JSON data and presents it to the user in a more consumable fashion. I wanted to give the UI a `dashboard` look and feel. All of the `payees` are presented in a `paginated` format. There are animated charts that offer a quick view and some `mouse over` data. The `payment information` element is an accordion that allows the user to toggle visibility of that information. The `payor` list shows the critical data prominently. If you want a sneak peek, you can jump to the [Screenshots](#Screenshots) section to see what I put together.

Again, thank you so much for taking the time to look over my work. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me! Take care!

## **Notes**

Even though I completed the task that was asked of me, there is still room for improvement! As part of future development and other considerations, I have a small list of items that I would want to add and/or improve.
- Add: Search bar with a drop down that will let you quickly choose a Payee
- Refactor: There is room to dry out my code and to streamline certain elements
- Validation: Create unit tests and make more considerations for validation of data/form entry (validate search bar entry, validate JSON data is as expected, etc.)
- Review: Review some design patterns and look for ways to improve consistency of logic and structure
